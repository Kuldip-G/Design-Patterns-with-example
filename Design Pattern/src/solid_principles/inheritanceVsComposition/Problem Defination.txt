Inheritance is a relationship and composition is a "HAS A" relationship.

There are some disadvantages working with inheritance

1.A subclass can’t reduce the interface of the superclass.

2.• When overriding methods you need to make sure that the
new behavior is compatible with the base one

3.• Inheritance breaks encapsulation of the superclass

4. Subclasses are tightly coupled to superclasses

5.• Trying to reuse code through inheritance can lead to creating parallel inheritance hierarchies
